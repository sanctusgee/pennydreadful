Penny Dreadful

A blog web application written in Python and Flask.

Installation

    From the command-line, run "source setup/install_venv" to auto-create a virtual environment, and install all the required modules/libraries

    Run the setup/db_create.py and setup/db_upgrade.py scripts to create the SQLite database

Running

Flask comes with an in-build development web server: from the command prompt, execute the run.py script with the Python interpreter from the virtual environment created in step 1 (above).
